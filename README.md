# Learning-CPP
Welcome to Learning-CPP. This repository is my attempt to give newcomers a practical intorduction to C++.

## Structure
I have fragemented this repo depending on use case and expirience you have with C++.

The "Introduction" folder goes over the fundamentals of C++ and gives you the tools to express your ideas. 
Each folder contained within this directory, consists of a markdown file explaining the concepts and code, 
and is supplemented with the code files for your explorations.

The "Data Structures & Algorithms" folder goes over important DSA concepts implemented in C++. 
It is assumed that you are familiar with the language and essential computer science concepts at this point.

The "Data Science" folder introduces you data science techniques implemented in C++. 

## Remarks
It is my hope that this repository helps you improve your coding skills and gives you the tools 
for creative self-expression using code.
